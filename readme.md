# RRT (Retrospective Revision Timetable)

[] We want to take the table of contents for a textbook
[] We want to mark down when we have read a chapter or subsection
[] We want to calculate expected completion time
[] We want to auto-generate the best times to go back and re-study certain sections
[] We want to create a "bank" of useful exercises from the books
